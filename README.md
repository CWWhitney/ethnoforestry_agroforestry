## Ethnoforestry and Agroforestry

Ethnoforestry is the study and practice of the relationship between people and forests, particularly focusing on the traditional knowledge and cultural practices associated with forest management. This section provides an overview of the principles and significance of ethnoforestry. Agroforestry is an integrated land use management system that combines trees and shrubs with agricultural crops and/or livestock. This section explores the benefits, types, and implementation of agroforestry systems.
