# The Global Challenge & The Untapped Opportunity

.pull-left[
### **The Pressure on Forests**

- 31% of global land is forested
- Crucial for biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services
- Rising demand threatens these systems:
  - Timber
  - Fuelwood  
  - Agricultural land
]

.pull-right[
### **The Untapped Opportunity**

**Ethnoforestry**

- Integration of **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**
- Bridges ancestral wisdom with modern science
- Scalable, inclusive pathway for sustainable development

# Our Research Approach & Conceptual Model

.pull-left[
### **Research Objective**

Systematically explore how ethnoforestry contributes to sustainable and productive land management.

### **Methodology**

1. **Systematic Literature Review**
   - Keywords: "ethnoforestry," "TEK," "biodiversity," "development"
   - Databases: Web of Science, Scopus
   - Remove erroneous papers
   - Annotate 7000+ papers
   - Create a Term-Document Matrix (TDM)
]
